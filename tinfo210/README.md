# TINFO210
Project for tinfo210. Queries are stored here in JavaScript (Node.js)

## SingleTableCode Directory
Contains queries for the database (designed with a single table)
### Modules Directory
I made most of the queries into modules (needlessly). They are run from the Scripts directory.
### Scripts Directory
Run the queries from here. Most of the queries just import the module and call the function. This would make more sense if they were a little more robust.
