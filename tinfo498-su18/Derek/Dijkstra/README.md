# Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Shortest Path First, weighted edges

## Graph
Represent Graphs using:
 * Adjacency Matrix
 * Adjacency List
 * Adjacency Set


### Adjacency Matrix

N Nodes will require a matrix of NxN. Each cell in the matrix will have a 1 or 0. A 1 represents an edge between nodes. 0 represents no edges between those nodes. All diagonal nodes will be 0 (a node cannot be connected to itself). Undirected graphs will have symmetric values across the diagonal nodes.
